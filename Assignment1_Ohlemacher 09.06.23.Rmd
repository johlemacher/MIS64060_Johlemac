This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## 1. Using R Crabs dataset: ##https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/crabs.html

```{r}
## 2. Load Crabs Dataset
library(MASS)
data(crabs)

```

```{r}
## 3. Print descriptive stats for Crabs Dataset
summary_crabs <- summary(crabs)
print(summary_crabs)

```

```{r}
## Mean, Min, Max of BD
mean_BD <- mean(crabs$BD)
min_BD <- min(crabs$BD)
max_BD <- max(crabs$BD)
print(mean_BD)
print(min_BD)
print(max_BD)
```

```{r}
## Frequency table of species (categorical variable summary stat)
freqtable_sp <- table(crabs$sp)
print(freqtable_sp)
```
```{r}
## 3. Transform variable

## Group by species and sex
library(dplyr)
species_sex_group <- crabs %>% group_by(sp,sex)
print (species_sex_group)
```

```{r}
## Scale BD
scaled_BD <- scale(crabs$BD)
print(scaled_BD)

```

```{r}
## 4. Plot one quantitative variable and one scatterplot
library(ggplot2)

boxplot(crabs$BD)
```
```{r}
## Scatterplot
data(crabs)  
plot(crabs$CL, crabs$CW, main = "CL vs CW Scatterplot", xlab = "CL", ylab = "CW", pch = 16, col = "blue")

```

```{r}
## Plot one quantitative variable
ggplot(crabs, aes(x = BD, y = factor(sp))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Body Depth (BD)", y = "Species") +
  theme_minimal()

```
